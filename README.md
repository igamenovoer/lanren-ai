# Lanren AI (懒人 AI)

**One-click AI development environment setup for Windows.**

Lanren AI (懒人 AI) aims to make AI-powered coding tools accessible to everyone by offering simple, one-click installers that set up a complete development environment without requiring command-line knowledge.

## Project Goal

- Provide easy, one-click installers for popular AI coding tools and supporting utilities.
- Remove friction for new developers by handling installation, configuration, and basic integration automatically.
- Offer opinionated, ready-to-use setups that help people start using AI coding tools in minutes instead of hours.

## Who This Is For

- Developers new to AI coding tools.
- People who prefer double-click installers over manual setup.
- Teams that want a standardized, repeatable AI development environment.

## Project Status

This project is under active development. The initial focus is on a “common tools” pack that installs a practical baseline environment for AI-assisted coding on Windows.
