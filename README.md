# Lanren AI (懒人 AI)

**One-Click Installers and Configurations for AI Coding Tools**

Lanren AI is a C# project designed to simplify the setup and configuration of AI-powered coding tools and development stacks. The name "懒人" (Lanren) means "lazy person" in Chinese, reflecting our mission: making AI coding tools accessible to everyone without requiring complex manual configurations and command-line expertise.

## Vision

AI coding tools are powerful, but their setup can be intimidating for newcomers. This project aims to:
